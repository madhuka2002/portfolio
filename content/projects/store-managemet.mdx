## Introduction

This project serves as a foundational backend for an e-commerce platform, utilizing an event-driven microservices architecture. It leverages Docker for containerization and LocalStack to emulate AWS services locally, facilitating efficient development and testing. Communication between microservices is achieved through high-performance **gRPC**.

## Features

- **Event-Driven Microservices**: Decoupled services communicating via events.
- **gRPC Communication**: Efficient inter-service communication using gRPC.
- **Dockerized Setup**: Services run in isolated containers via Docker Compose.
- **AWS Emulation with LocalStack**: Local testing of AWS services.
- **Scalable and Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable and maintainable services.

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: Java
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Communication**: gRPC
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **AWS Emulation**: LocalStack
- **[Database]**: *Add your preferred database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)*

## Architecture Overview

The system is composed of several microservices, each responsible for specific functionalities:

- **API Gateway**: Routes client requests to appropriate services.
- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization.
- **User Service**: Manages user-related data and operations.
- **Billing Service**: Handles billing and payment logic.
- **Analytics Service**: Collects and processes analytics data.

All services communicate using **gRPC** to ensure high performance and scalability.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker
- Java 21
- Maven

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/madhuka2002/store-management.git
cd store-management
````

### Build Services

```bash
mvn clean install
```

### Start Services

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Make sure **Docker** and **LocalStack** are running before starting the services.

## Testing

To run integration tests:

```bash
cd integration-tests
mvn test
```

Ensure all services are up and running before executing tests.
