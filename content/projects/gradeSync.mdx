## Introduction

GradeSync-LMS is a Java-based Learning Management System (LMS) application developed using Apache NetBeans. It provides features to manage students, teachers, courses, and academic activities efficiently. This document provides information on how to set up, run, and maintain the application, including details about its structure and the technologies used.

## Features

- **Student and Teacher Management**: Manage profiles and academic activities.
- **Course Creation and Enrollment**: Create courses and enroll students.
- **Profile Editing and Password Management**: Update user profiles securely.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy navigation for all users.

## Tech Stack

The application is built using the following technologies:
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: Apache NetBeans
- **Database**: MongoDB (Note: The original text mentions MongoDB, but the setup instructions refer to MySQL or PostgreSQL. Ensure the correct database is used based on your setup.)
- **Version Control**: Git

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following main parts:
- **Frontend**: Contains all UI-related Java code for user interaction.
- **Backend**: Java classes handling business logic and database interactions.
- **Database**: Stores user data, courses, and other relevant information.
- **Config Files**: Includes environment settings and database configurations.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure that the following tools and software are installed:
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**:
  - Download and install the latest version of JDK.
  - Add the JDK bin directory to your system's PATH environment variable.
- **Apache NetBeans**:
  - Download and install Apache NetBeans.
  - Ensure that NetBeans is configured to use the installed JDK.

## Database Requirements

Ensure a supported database is installed and running (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL). Set up the database schema and populate it using the provided SQL scripts (if any).

## Installation Steps

### Clone or Extract the Project
- If you received this project as a RAR file, extract it to your desired location.
- If hosted on a repository, clone it using:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/madhuka2002/GradeSync-LMS.git
```

### Import into Apache NetBeans
1. Open Apache NetBeans.
2. Click on **File > Open Project**.
3. Browse to the extracted/cloned project folder and open it.

### Configure the Database
- Update the database connection settings in the project's configuration file (e.g., `config.properties` or similar).
- Ensure the database credentials (username, password, URL) are correctly set.

### Build the Project
1. In NetBeans, right-click on the project in the "Projects" window.
2. Select **Clean and Build**.

### Run the Application
1. **Start the Database Server**:
 - Ensure your database server is running and accessible.
2. **Run the Application**:
 - In NetBeans, right-click on the project in the "Projects" window.
 - Select **Run** or press `F6`.
3. **Access the Application**:
 - If web-based, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.
 - If desktop-based, the interface will load directly.

## Troubleshooting

### NetBeans Cannot Find the Main Class
- Verify that the main class is correctly specified in the project's properties:
- Right-click on the project in NetBeans, go to **Properties > Run**, and check the Main Class field.

### Database Connection Issues
- Ensure your database server is running and accessible.
- Double-check connection settings in the configuration file.

### Dependency Errors
- Verify that all required libraries (e.g., `.jar` files) are added to the project.
- Add missing dependencies via **Libraries** in NetBeans.

## Deployment

To deploy the application, follow these steps:
- **Upload Project Files**: Upload project files to a server.
- **Set Up the Database**: Set up the MySQL or PostgreSQL database on the server and import the SQL file.
- **Update Database Credentials**: Update `config.properties` with the live database credentials.
