I'm a software engineer based in Colombo, Sri Lanka with a passion for creating clean, efficient, and user-friendly web applications. With expertise in both frontend and backend technologies, I specialize in building modern web applications using React, Next.js, and Node.js.

I'm constantly learning and experimenting with new technologies to stay ahead in this ever-evolving field. When I'm not coding, you can find me sharing my knowledge through blog posts and contributing to open-source projects.
