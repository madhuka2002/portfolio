# 🧠 Automating with Agentic AI in n8n

**n8n** (pronounced "n-eight-n") is a powerful workflow automation tool. But when you add **Agentic AI**, it becomes an intelligent orchestration platform capable of thinking, deciding, and acting.

Let’s explore how to bring LLM-driven agents to life in n8n — without writing code.

---

## ⚙️ What Is Agentic AI in n8n?

Agentic AI in this context means:

* Using **LLMs (GPT, Claude, Mistral, etc.)**
* Giving them **tools** (via n8n nodes)
* Letting them **observe, think, act**
* Retaining **memory** using variables or databases
* Making **autonomous decisions**

> 🧭 In short: LLM + tools + memory + control flow = Agentic AI

---

## 🔁 Sample Use Case: Smart Customer Follow-Up

Here’s a simple **Agentic AI Workflow** in n8n:

```yaml
Trigger: New Form Submission
→ LLM Node: Analyze intent and urgency
→ IF Node: Check if VIP client
→ Tool Node: Generate email with OpenAI
→ Gmail Node: Send email
→ Notion Node: Log interaction
→ Slack Node: Notify support
````

---

## 🧩 Node Breakdown

### 🧠 LLM (OpenAI, Mistral, Azure OpenAI)

Use this node to:

* Understand user intent
* Summarize or generate text
* Extract structured data

🧪 Prompt example:

```
You are a support agent. Given the user's message, classify urgency as High, Medium, or Low. Output JSON:
{
  "urgency": "High"
}
```

---

### 📥 Memory via n8n Variables

Use n8n’s:

* `Set` node → store session variables
* `IF` node → conditionally control flow
* `Function` node → manage memory logic
* `Data Stores` or `Postgres/MySQL` → persistent memory

```js
// Function node example
items[0].json.memory = {
  lastClient: "Alice",
  urgency: "High"
};
return items;
```

---

## 🛠️ Tool Nodes = Agent Actions

Tools are external actions. Your agent doesn't just think — it **acts** via these nodes:

* `HTTP Request`: Call APIs
* `Google Calendar`: Book meetings
* `Notion`: Log summaries
* `Gmail`: Send emails
* `Webhook`: Trigger actions elsewhere

---

## 🔄 Chaining Agents in n8n

Want multi-step reasoning?

Use **LLM → memory → tool → feedback loop** like this:

```yaml
1. Analyze query
2. Plan steps (using an LLM)
3. Loop through plan with IF & Switch
4. Call tools in order
5. Store results and respond
```

🧠 Tip: Use `Execute Workflow` node for modular agents.

---

## 🔐 Guardrails & Validation

Protect your workflow using:

* `IF` conditions
* Prompt constraints ("Don't send emails unless authorized")
* Function node checks
* Admin review gates

🔒 Example:

```js
if (items[0].json.urgency === "High" && !items[0].json.isVIP) {
  throw new Error("Non-VIP cannot trigger priority flow.");
}
```

---

## 🔍 Debugging & Testing

Use:

* `n8n Execution Logs`
* `Console.log` in Function node
* `Manual Trigger` for step-by-step
* Environment variables for safe testing

---

## 💡 Best Practices

✅ Use clear system prompts

✅ Store important context early

✅ Split big workflows into subflows

✅ Use `Set`, `Function`, and `IF` nodes for logic

✅ Reuse prompt templates with variables

✅ Track state (steps completed, last tool used)
