# 🌿 Introduction to Spring Core

If you're stepping into the world of Java enterprise development, **Spring Core** is your gateway. It's the foundation module of the **Spring Framework**, providing features for **dependency injection**, **bean lifecycle management**, and **annotation-based configuration**.

Let’s dive deep into Spring Core and understand why it's a game-changer for Java developers.

---

## 💡 What is Spring Core?

Spring Core is a module that gives you the tools to manage the objects (beans) in your application through the concept of **Inversion of Control (IoC)** and **Dependency Injection (DI)**.

---

## 🔄 Inversion of Control (IoC)

**Inversion of Control** is a principle where the control of object creation and dependency resolution is handed over to the **Spring Container**, rather than being managed manually in your code.

> Think of it like hiring a personal assistant: instead of you remembering to call the plumber, your assistant (Spring) does it for you automatically.

---

## 🧩 Dependency Injection (DI)

**Dependency Injection** is a technique to supply objects (dependencies) a class needs without creating them inside the class. This makes your code:

- Easier to **test**
- Easier to **maintain**
- More **flexible** to extend

---

## 🧰 Types of Dependency Injection

### 1. 🧪 Constructor Injection (CI)


{`@Component
public class Car {

    private final Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}`}


✅ Best for mandatory dependencies  
🚫 Slightly verbose if many dependencies

---

### 2. 🧑‍🔧 Setter Injection (SI)


{`@Component
public class Car {

    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public void setEngine(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}`}


✅ Best for optional dependencies  
🚫 Can lead to partially initialized objects

---

## 🧠 Real-World Analogy: DI Explained

Imagine you're building a computer:

- **Without DI**: You create all parts (CPU, RAM, HDD) inside the computer class.
- **With DI**: You receive all parts from an external supplier (Spring) and just assemble them.

## 🏛️ IoC Containers: BeanFactory vs ApplicationContext

Spring provides containers that manage the lifecycle of beans.

🔸 Lazy Initialization

    BeanFactory: ✅ Yes
    
    ApplicationContext: ❌ No (eager by default)

🔸 Internationalization Support

    BeanFactory: ❌ No
    
    ApplicationContext: ✅ Yes

🔸 Event Publishing

    BeanFactory: ❌ No

    ApplicationContext: ✅ Yes

🔸 AOP Integration

    BeanFactory: ❌ No

    ApplicationContext: ✅ Yes

## 🧬 Bean Scopes in Spring

🔹 singleton
→ One instance per Spring container (default)

🔹 prototype
→ A new instance is created every time it’s requested

🔹 request
→ One instance per HTTP request (for web applications)

🔹 session
→ One instance per HTTP session (for web applications)

```java
@Component
@Scope("prototype")
public class Employee {}
```

## 🔖 Annotations in Spring Core

### Basic Annotations

- `@Component` – Marks a class as a Spring-managed bean.
- `@Autowired` – Injects the dependency automatically.
- `@Qualifier` – Helps resolve ambiguity with multiple beans.
- `@Value` – Injects primitive values or properties.

---

## 📦 JSR-250 Annotations

JSR-250 provides Java-standard annotations that Spring supports:

@PostConstruct
→ This method is called after the bean has been initialized.

@PreDestroy
→ This method is called right before the bean is destroyed.

@Resource
→ Injects a dependency by name.

---

## 📦 JSR-330 Annotations

These are from the `javax.inject` package:

@Inject
→ Serves as an alternative to Spring’s @Autowired.

@Named
→ Can be used in place of @Component.

@Singleton
→ Ensures that only one instance of the bean is created.

---

## 🧬 Bean Lifecycle & Callbacks

The bean lifecycle includes:

1. Instantiation
2. Populating properties (DI)
3. `@PostConstruct` or `afterPropertiesSet()`
4. Bean is ready for use
5. `@PreDestroy` or `destroy()`


{`@Component
public class Service {

    @PostConstruct
    public void init() {
        System.out.println("Initialized!");
    }

    @PreDestroy
    public void cleanup() {
        System.out.println("Destroyed!");
    }
}`}


---

## ⚖️ XML vs Annotation-based Config

Spring originally used XML for everything.

```xml
<bean id="myService" class="com.app.MyService"/>
```

Now we use annotations like:

```java
@Component
public class MyService {}
```

➡️ **Annotation-based config is now the standard.**

---

## 🧠 Best Practices

✅ Prefer Constructor Injection  
✅ Use `@Qualifier` for multiple implementations  
✅ Avoid field injection for testability  
✅ Use `@PostConstruct` instead of custom init methods  
✅ Use interfaces for better decoupling

---

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls

❌ Circular Dependencies (A needs B, B needs A)  
❌ Mixing too many annotations without structure  
❌ Overusing prototype scope in singletons  
❌ Injecting optional beans without `@Nullable` or `Optional`

---

## ✅ Quick Quiz

1. Which injection type is better for mandatory dependencies?  
2. What is the default scope of a Spring bean?  
3. Name one annotation from JSR-330.  
4. What's the difference between `@Component` and `@Named`?

---

## 📌 FAQ

**Q: Is Spring Core only for web apps?**  
A: No! Spring Core can be used in any Java application.

**Q: Can I mix XML and annotations?**  
A: Yes, though it's not recommended for large projects.

**Q: Is `@Inject` the same as `@Autowired`?**  
A: Functionally, yes – but `@Inject` is from JSR-330.
