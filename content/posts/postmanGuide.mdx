# 🚀 Introduction to Postman

If you're working with APIs, **Postman** is your go-to tool. It allows developers to **test, document, and automate RESTful APIs** with ease. Whether you're building a simple CRUD API or testing complex workflows, Postman simplifies every step.

Let’s dive in and unlock the true power of Postman!

---

## 🔄 CRUD Operations in Postman

### ✅ Create (POST)
Used to send data to the server to create a new resource.

```http
POST /api/users
````

**Body (raw/JSON):**

```json
{
  "name": "Madhuka",
  "email": "madhuka@mail.com"
}
```

---

### 📥 Read (GET)

Used to retrieve information.

```http
GET /api/users
```

---

### ✏️ Update (PUT / PATCH)

Update an existing resource.

```http
PUT /api/users/1
```

**Body:**

```json
{
  "email": "updated@mail.com"
}
```

---

### ❌ Delete (DELETE)

Remove a resource.

```http
DELETE /api/users/1
```

---

## 🌎 Environment Variables

Environment variables help you switch between different setups (like **local**, **staging**, **production**) without rewriting URLs or tokens.

🔧 **Example:**

* `{{base_url}}` → `http://localhost:8080`
* `{{token}}` → `Bearer your_jwt_token_here`

You can set these in:

> ⚙️ Environment Settings → Manage Environments

Then use `{{base_url}}/api/users` in your requests.

---

## 🔍 Request Body & Parameters

Postman supports multiple body types:

* `raw` (JSON, XML, Text)
* `form-data` (for file uploads)
* `x-www-form-urlencoded`

And also allows you to add:

* **Query Params:** `/users?page=1`
* **Path Variables:** `/users/:id`

💡 Tip: Use `Params` tab for query parameters and `Pre-request Script` for dynamic body construction.

---

## 📬 Headers & Authentication

Use the **Headers tab** to add custom headers like:

* `Authorization`: Bearer token
* `Content-Type`: application/json

Also supports:

* Basic Auth
* Bearer Tokens
* API Key
* OAuth 2.0

---

## 📟 Status Codes

Postman will show response codes, time, and size. Key HTTP Status Codes:

* `200 OK`: Request succeeded
* `201 Created`: Resource created
* `400 Bad Request`: Client error
* `401 Unauthorized`: Auth required
* `404 Not Found`: Resource not found
* `500 Internal Server Error`: Server crash

---

## ⚙️ Automation with Tests

Postman supports JavaScript-based test automation.

```js
pm.test("Status is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Content-Type is JSON", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.header("Content-Type");
});
```

You can write **test cases** to validate responses, headers, values, response times, etc.

---

## 🔁 Pre-request Script & Chaining Requests

Use **Pre-request Scripts** to set values before sending a request.

```js
pm.environment.set("userId", "1234");
```

You can also **chain** requests by storing data in variables:

```js
let response = pm.response.json();
pm.environment.set("userId", response.id);
```

Then use `{{userId}}` in the next request.

---

## 📦 Collections & Folders

Group your requests into **collections** for better organization.

* Folders group requests logically (e.g., Auth, User, Orders)
* Collections can be exported and shared across teams

---

## 📋 Collection Runner

Run an entire collection of requests **sequentially** with predefined data.

You can import a CSV or JSON file to test with multiple sets of data (Data-Driven Testing).

---

## 📜 Console for Debugging

Use the **Postman Console** (View → Show Postman Console or `Ctrl + Alt + C`) to:

* Log variables
* Debug pre-request/test scripts
* Inspect full request & response

```js
console.log("Token is: ", pm.environment.get("token"));
```

---

## 💡 Useful Tips

✅ Use variables to avoid repetition
✅ Save frequent requests as collections
✅ Write tests for expected outcomes
✅ Use `pm.environment` and `pm.globals` wisely
✅ Share environment and collections with your team

---

## 🚫 Common Mistakes

❌ Forgetting to set `Content-Type`
❌ Mixing path and query parameters
❌ Not saving updated environments
❌ Overwriting global variables accidentally

## 📌 FAQ

**Q: Can Postman be used with GraphQL?**
A: Yes! Postman has built-in support for GraphQL requests.

**Q: Can I export my collections?**
A: Absolutely. You can export and import collections, environments, and more.

**Q: Can I use Postman for automated testing?**
A: Yes — use tests, the Collection Runner, and Newman (CLI tool) for automation.
